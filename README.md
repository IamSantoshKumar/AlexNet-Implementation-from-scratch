# AlexNet-Implementation-from-scratch

AlexNet was much larger than previous CNNs used for computer vision tasks ( e.g. Yann LeCunâ€™s LeNet paper in 1998). It has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons and took five to six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. Today there are much more complex CNNs that can run on faster GPUs very efficiently even on very large datasets. But back in 2012, this was huge!
